        <h3 id="About" class="bg-info text-white text-center lead">About Us</h3>
        <p class="text-center">The Happiness Fund is a non-profit organization located in Tampa Florida. We were founded in 2018 after a close relative had passed away. I was never happy and wanted to change that so I created the Happiness Fund. Many say money doesn't buy happiness but we disagree. We will grant your every wish until you are happy.Here at the Happiness Fund we understand how people feel when they aren't happy, and we want to change that. Everyone we come in contact with we treat with the upmost respect. We care for our patients and want them to be happy and live their best life. Thats why we grant every wish.</p>
        <h3 id="Happiness" class="bg-info text-white text-center lead">Why Happiness Matters</h3>
        <p class="text-center">Sometimes when we pick up a newspaper or see the news on television, it seems as though the world is filled with doom and gloom and, even in our own hectic lives, it would be foolish to think that we could feel happy every moment of our waking lives. But is a state of being happy that far from being attained by us all? The answer is no – it is within our own grasp.

We tend to forget how important happiness is and get consumed with our own negative feelings of doom and gloom from time to time too. Furthermore, we sometimes don’t consciously realise we are doing this to ourselves. Thats why we are here we want you to be happy and if you aren't happy we aren't happy. Times are hard and sometimes you can't do anything about it, so come with us and be happy.</p>
